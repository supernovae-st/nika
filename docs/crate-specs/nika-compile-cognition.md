# Crate spec — `nika-compile-cognition`

| | |
|---|---|
| Status | **MEMBER** — implemented size-cap split of the admitted `nika-onboard` unit under the authorized V7 consolidation, ADR-140 and D-2026-07-09-N1 |
| Layer | L4; production edges to core, Reader and Fidelity, never a core-to-cognition edge |
| Design | Explicit seat orchestration: COLD proposals, bounded decisions, native/revision/sketch authoring, verified transforms and knowledge recall |
| LOC budget | ≤15k production lines per crate; ≤1500/file; existing function-length ratchets follow their moved functions |
| Version / edition / license | Workspace version / 2024 / AGPL-3.0-or-later |
| Publish | `false`; member of the same architectural unit |
| Diagnostics | Existing `CompileOutcome` and `CompileError` contracts; no new NIKA codes |

The member reads `nika_compile::surface` and the core's public request/outcome types.
`CompileRequest` and `AuthoringPolicy` remain core-owned with their builders; `Cognition`
and decision seats live here. `nika-onboard::compile` combines both members at the existing
consumer paths. Provider choice and admission context remain host-owned and explicit.

`cognition` owns the orchestration ladder; its children own proposal decoding, native
answers/judgment/repairs, sketch filling, verified transforms and knowledge references.
`compose`, `predicate` and `decide` move with their complete tests. The deterministic
native record application and replay stay in core and are shared by accepted candidates
and answer rounds. Candidate, fidelity and sketch laws come from `nika-compile-fidelity`
(ADR-141); no Reader implementation is duplicated.

The spec pin and canonical expression laws are read from core, including by the retained
knowledge/transform tests. Kernel inference, bounded Tokio timeouts and jaq/capability
verification belong to this member; they do not add a production dependency back from core.

The core integration suites retain all test bodies and fixtures, using a development edge
to this member for seat entry points. Qualification requires their execution on the
composed workspace plus member unit tests, clippy, docs, API and hygiene checks. Admission
is inherited from the unit; mutation and property attestations remain pending, never
claimed by this split. Existing public-type ratchet debt is unchanged.
